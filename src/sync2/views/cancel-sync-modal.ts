// 2.0.2-beta2 ribbon-click confirmation modal. Fires when the user
// clicks the [Sync with GitHub] ribbon icon while a drain is
// already running. The previous behaviour ("silently ignore the
// click") was confusing — the user couldn't tell whether the click
// registered, and there was no clear path to stop a stuck sync
// from the icon they just clicked.
//
// Two buttons:
//   [Cancel sync] (red CTA) → triggers Sync2Manager.cancelDrain()
//                              + closes the modal.
//   [Keep going]            → just closes; current drain continues.
//
// Distinct from the TokenExpiredModal: this one is for a healthy
// in-flight sync the user wants to abort, not for an auth failure.

// Wire-format types shared between the main-thread `WorkerClient`
// and the two worker entry points (`cpu-worker.ts`, `network-worker.ts`).
//
// Discriminated unions on `op` give us exhaustive type checking on
// both sides; `id` is a per-request UUID that the client uses to
// route the reply back to the right pending Promise. The same envelope
// works for both CPU and network workers — dispatch happens client-side.
//
// Stage 3 ships only `ping` and `echo` ops. Stages 4-6 add the real
// work (decode-base64, merge-text, compute-sha, github-* calls).

  // when GitHub's Blobs API returns the file content as base64.

  // for a binary buffer. Used by reconcile to compare ours/theirs
  // SHAs without touching the network.

  // the response payload along with retry-loop state. The actual
  // retry policy lives main-thread-side (per-call: getContentsAtRef
  // distinguishes 404 from 5xx differently than createBlob does),
  // but each individual fetch happens in the worker so the engine
  // stays single-point-of-network-execution.

// Stage 2.1 — the `[← back]` 7-step pair-atomic commit + crash recovery
// (DIFF-EDITOR.md §5.0–§5.0.e).
//
// `[← back]` commits BOTH sides of a conflict back to the vault at once:
// the resolved base and the resolved sibling (from `split(fromEditorModel)`,
// surfaced by DiffPane.getResolved()). A naive "two sequential
// atomicWriteFile" loses ver2 edits on a crash between the two writes (and the
// onload sync pulse runs BEFORE the user can reopen, so a half-committed pair
// would be pushed to the remote). This protocol records the expected SHAs in a
// `done.json` commit barrier FIRST, then stages + promotes both files, so
// recovery on the next launch is a deterministic function of what's on disk —
// it can always roll forward to the committed state or cleanly roll back to the
// autosave session, atomically for the PAIR, before the engine touches the vault.
//
// WRITE STRATEGY (bug3): the promote writes IN PLACE via `vault.modifyBinary`
// when the target is an existing TFile — the editor-friendly path that
// PRESERVES an open tab's cursor/scroll. The previous safeRename swap made
// Obsidian see the file vanish and closed the tab. modifyBinary is NOT atomic
// (a crash can leave a torn final), but the done.json + clean `.sync-tmp` make
// recovery deterministic anyway: a torn final WITH our clean tmp is OUR write →
// roll forward from the tmp; a non-matching final WITHOUT our clean tmp is a
// genuine external edit → fall back. The original is never renamed aside, so
// there is no `.sync-bak` (rollback only happens before any modify, when the
// originals are still intact). New files (no TFile) atomically rename the tmp.
//
// SCOPE: this module is the commit engine + TOCTOU detector + per-dir
// recovery. WIRED into the view as of W1: `commit7Step` is the `[←]` save
// (DiffEditView.exitDetailView), `classifyToctou` gates it, and `recoverCommit`
// runs at onload via `onload-recovery.ts` (before AtomicWriteRecovery.sweep).
// The §5.0.e symmetric exit-TOCTOU is WIRED as of W5: commitUnchangedSide
// (one side changed → silent) + commitToAlt (both changed → SaveToAltModal).
// Still Phase-6 polish: the `committing` UI guard (Step 0) and Step 8
// (detachLeaf + historyClear). The naive `exit-protocol.ts` is deleted.
//
// Canonical spec: docs/tasks/DIFF-EDITOR.md §5.0 (7 steps), §5.0.a/b
// (recovery sweep + A–K matrix), §5.0.c (orphan discrimination), §5.0.e
// (TOCTOU). atomic-write.ts staging-path convention (SYNC2 §2.4 / PSEUDO-
// MERGE-MODE §9.2/§9.3).

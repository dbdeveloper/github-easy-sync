// User-driven-delete interception via monkey-patch of Vault.delete and
// Vault.trash. On plugin onload we wrap both methods so they call
// TrashStore.intercept(file.path) BEFORE invoking the original (file
// bytes are still on disk at that point — adapter.readBinary works).
// On plugin unload we restore the originals so the plugin leaves the
// vault in the state it found it.
//
// Canonical specs:
//   - docs/DIFF2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md §R3.2, §R3.4
//   - docs/DIFF2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md §R3.10 (intercept algorithm)
//
// Pattern, blast radius, and limitations:
//
//   - We only patch the high-level Vault methods (vault.delete /
//     vault.trash). Calls that bypass these by going directly to
//     adapter.remove(path) — including sync2's own applyRemoteDeletion
//     — do NOT trigger this watcher. sync2's pull-delete path
//     captures via the constructor-injected trashHooks.captureForDelete
//     hook instead (R3.4). Third-party plugins that delete via the
//     adapter are NOT captured by design (see DIFF2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
//     R3.4 "Design boundary").
//
//   - Multiple plugins can patch the same method (each captures the
//     previous wrapped version as its "original"). On uninstall we
//     restore the reference we captured at install time, leaving any
//     plugin-stack above us intact. LIFO-style unwrap.
//
//   - Folder deletion is NOT captured in v1. When the user deletes a
//     folder, Obsidian's `vault.delete(folder)` proceeds without
//     iterating children one-by-one through our patched method. The
//     children disappear without trash entries. This is a known
//     limitation; if it becomes a meaningful UX pain we can revisit by
//     pre-walking the folder before delegating to the original. Files
//     deleted individually via the file menu / command palette ARE
//     captured.
//
//   - Capture is best-effort. If intercept throws (disk full, permission
//     error, ...) we log and proceed with the original delete anyway.
//     TrashStore is a safety net for the common case, not a hard
//     dependency for delete itself.

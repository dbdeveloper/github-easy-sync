// B7 — regression guard for the "interrupted adoption + canonicalize ON
// → 96-file convergence push" surprise that hit a real Android user.
//
// Scenario being reproduced:
//   1) Fresh client on a new device, autoCanonicalize: true.
//   2) Adoption starts: bootstrapFromRemote pulls files from GitHub
//      and writes them locally as canonical bytes (LF/no-BOM/trailing-
//      NL). recordSync is intentionally skipped for any file whose
//      bytes were rewritten (this is the documented "convergence push"
//      escape hatch).
//   3) Process dies mid-adoption (Android suspending the JS runtime
//      after Obsidian goes to background; or a crash; or the user
//      force-closing the app). lastSyncCommitSha is NOT yet set —
//      it lands at the end of bootstrapFromRemote, which never ran.
//   4) Plugin restarts. syncAll routes back into bootstrapIfNeeded →
//      bootstrapFromRemote.
//   5) Resume sees the partially-written files: they exist on disk
//      with canonical bytes; their git-blob SHA does NOT match the
//      raw remote item.sha (because remote bytes had CRLF/BOM).
//
// The bug: before the canonicalize-aware resume hint, step 5 fell
// into the mtime branch — local mtime (just-written, "now") was
// always newer than the remote commit date, so the file was
// classified as "local wins", recordSync was skipped again, and the
// next findChanges emitted it as "added" and pushed the canonical
// bytes back to GitHub as if they were user content. For a vault
// with N non-canonical files, that's an N-file commit on first
// setup that the user neither intended nor expected.
//
// The fix: bootstrapFromRemote now refetches the blob, canonicalizes
// it the same way writeRemoteText would, recomputes the SHA, and if
// the canonical-SHA matches the local SHA, treats the file as
// identical (recordSync against canonical SHA) instead of falling
// into mtime branch.
//
// Simulated kill: we don't actually need to interrupt — we just
// pre-stage the vault to match the on-disk state a killed adoption
// would have produced (canonical bytes, no snapshot entries, no
// lastSync). Then run syncAll and assert that no convergence push
// commit appears.

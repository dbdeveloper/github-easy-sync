// C2 — resume of a crashed push. Mirrors C1 (resume-bootstrap-pull)
// but on the push side: when `createBlob` fails mid-batch (network
// drop, kill, etc.), the SHAs of the binaries that DID make it
// through must persist somewhere durable so the retry can skip them.
// PushQueue stores them in the batch's .meta.json (uploadedBlobs
// map); TreeBuilder consults the map before each createBlob.
//
// Why this matters: GitHub deduplicates blobs by content SHA, so
// repeat uploads don't grow storage — but the bytes ARE re-sent over
// the wire each time. For a multi-megabyte vault on a flaky mobile
// link, that's the difference between "resume in a few seconds" and
// "starts over every time".

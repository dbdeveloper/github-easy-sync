// iterates remote tree entries and downloads each blob in turn. If
// the network drops mid-loop (or the user kills Obsidian), the
// already-downloaded files persist on disk and in the snapshot store,
// but lastSyncCommitSha stays null because it's only set after the
// loop completes — so the next syncAll re-enters bootstrap. The
// resume-skip clause in `bootstrapFromRemote` keys off the existing
// snapshot entry: if the local file's recorded remoteSha matches the
// blob SHA the tree announces and the file actually exists on disk,
// we skip the getBlob call entirely.
//
// This test also serves as the deep-nesting smoke test for sync2:
// seeded paths include depths 1, 2, 3, and 4 — a real-world Obsidian
// vault shape that no other integration test exercises today.

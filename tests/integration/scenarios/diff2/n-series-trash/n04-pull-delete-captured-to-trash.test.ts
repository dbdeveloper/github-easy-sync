// n04 — R3.4 pull-delete capture + R3.5 recovery-window semantics.
//
// Sequence:
//   1. Remote has a file. Local syncs → file lands in vault.
//   2. Remote deletes the file.
//   3. Local syncs → applyRemoteDeletion fires trashHooks.captureForDelete
//      BEFORE adapter.remove → trash entry created with the file's
//      original bytes. File then removed from vault.
//   4. The entry's id is GREATER than this drain's drain.startedAt
//      (capture happened mid-drain). Layer 2 sweep at end of THIS
//      drain skips (id > threshold) — recovery window stays open.
//   5. Next sync (drain.startedAt_2 > entry.id). Layer 2 wipes.
//
// Verifies the entire R3.4 contract: pull-delete IS captured (against
// the older "bypass" reading), recovery survives exactly one drain
// cycle, second drain reclaims.

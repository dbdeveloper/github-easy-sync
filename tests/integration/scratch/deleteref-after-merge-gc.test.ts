// PSEUDO-MERGE-MODE.md §"Open questions" #2 (stage 7a empirical
// check): after we createCommit a merge with branch.head as a
// parent and then deleteReference the branch — does GitHub GC the
// branch's commits, or does merge-commit reachability keep them
// alive?
//
// Standard git: an object is reachable iff any ref points at it OR
// it's an ancestor of something reachable. A merge commit on main
// with parents=[main.head, branch.head] makes branch.head an
// ancestor of main → object stays. We verify GitHub's implementation
// matches.
